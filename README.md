# Auto Driving Car Simulation(Assignment for GIC)

This repository holds the code for a simple autonomous car prototype built with Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles and Arrange, Act and Assert (AAA) Pattern for unit tests. The car navigates on a rectangular field, responding to movement commands like F (forward), L (left turn), and R (right turn).
